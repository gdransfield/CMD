#Instructions

1. Install the requirements:
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the script entitled 'model_spectra_download.py'.
    $ python model_spectra_download.py
This will download the 10640 model spectra files from Vizie-R directly to the folder called 'model_spectra'.

3. Trust and then start the jupyter notebook CMD_toolkit:
    $ jupyter trust CMD_toolkit.ipynb
    $ jupyter notebook CMD_toolkit.ipynb

4. Click 'toggle code' to hide the blocks of code and interact with the notebook using HTML widgets.

5. Click 'Run all' from the 'Cells' drop down menu on the toolbar at the top.



#As this notebook makes use of polynomial coefficients computed by Dupuy & Liu (2012) and model spectra computed by Molli`ere (2015), please cite their papers in addition to ours.
